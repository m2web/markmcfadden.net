## *I love technology*

I am a Software Developer that is currently doing software development
for a large insurance/financial institution as well as teaching at a
local university.

I love learning new software languages and technologies. I also enjoy
learning how these new tools can better serve both businesses and
individuals. Moreover, I have 23 years experience in the Information
Technologies field specializing in the skills of Internet technologies,
Network Administration, ASP/Visual Basic, .Net, J2E, Ruby on Rails, and
JavaScript application design and development. I have designed and
implemented several Internet based systems ranging from static
“brochureware” sites to dynamic e-commerce solutions.

Concerning my functioning as part-time faculty, I am utilizing my
experience and teaching Business Application Development, Introduction
to Database, as well as Information Technology Governance at a local
university.
